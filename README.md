# ðŸ“¸ Computer Vision Fundamentals and GPU Acceleration Projects

This repository contains a series of three in-depth projects completed for the **Advanced Computer Vision** course, demonstrating a strong foundation in classical image processing, object recognition (OCR), quantitative assessment, and high-performance computing (HPC) acceleration using GPUs.
